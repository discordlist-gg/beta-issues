:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

**Reporting Bugs**  
Before creating bug reports, please search through the [issues](https://github.com/discordlist-gg/beta-issues/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. 
If you do create one, please include as many details as possible.

Before creating issues:  
- Do **not** paste a link such as `mycool-domain.com/screen_recording.mov`  to describe/showcase your issue. Videos that you host on your own server are most likely deleted after some time, causing your issue to have an expiration date. You can upload a video normally by dragging an .mp4 file into the markdown field.

**Failing to follow the rules may result in your issue being closed.**


Thank you!
